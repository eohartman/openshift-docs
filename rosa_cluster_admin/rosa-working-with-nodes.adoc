toc::[]

As a {product-title} (ROSA) administrator, you can perform several tasks to make your clusters more efficient. You can use the `oc adm` command to cordon, uncordon, and drain a specific node. This is available for both ROSA Classic and {hcp-title-first} clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Cordoning and draining are only allowed on worker nodes that are part of OCM machine pools.
